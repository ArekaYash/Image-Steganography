Java Code for Image Steganography

Takes a message from user and simply "hides" it in the image. 

This is done by changing the least significant bits (LSBs) of the binary values of the pixels of the image. 
Since the change in colour due to change in binary values of pixels is so minute, it is undetectable by the human eye. 
Hence the message is hidden and undectable.
